	<h1>The Party World</h1>
	<p>Party World is a world powered by music. Every day, songs are played so that the residents can dance and help keep the world alive. Disco doesn't agree that it's the locals who should be dancing to keep the planet alive, it's too many hours of dancing, so she tries to go against her father and implement dancing robots instead. But he doesn't like the idea at all because it's too much work to do.</p>
